### About me 
Tell us about yourself. I have now quit my job to dedicate my full time to teaching. I study on my own, from time to time, consulting with a mentor.

I have taken many free courses, the full list can be found here: https://qqkostya.github.io/. Also, I implemented several of my own pet projects, they can be found on github: https://github.com/qqKostya

I chose Python as my main first stack, but now I decided to learn front-end.

In addition, I have experience with Docker and Docker Compose, deploying databases (PostgreSQL) and raising servers, deploying projects on Heroku and working with REST API.

Now I continue to actively develop in the field of web development. Every day I watch thematic YouTube channels, read portals and telegram channels, and of course, I take further courses.
